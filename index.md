# Risk Assessment Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System
### Application Project

**Khadija & Maddy**

Introductory paragraph: Risk assessment algorithms are a tool used by the courts, usually judges and prosecutors, to predict the probablity of a defendent repeating criminal activity based on a selection of individual attributes(demographics, criminal history, etc.).

Background paragraph: Although these algorithms are an attempt to minimize personal and institutional bias in the judicial system, the algorithms are based on historical recidivism data that *has* been influenced by unequal institutional systems. When the inputs to an algorithm are biased the outputs are sure to display the same biases regardless of the intent of the designers or users.
        
Transition paragraph: What keen insight did you apply
        to overcome the shortcomings of other approaches?
        Structure this paragraph like a syllogism:
        Whereas P and P => Q, infer Q.
        
Details paragraph: What technical challenges did you have
        to overcome and what kinds of validation did you perform?

Assessment paragraph: Assess your results and briefly state
        the broadly interesting conclusions that these results
        support. This may only take a couple of sentences. I
        usually then follow these sentences by an optional
        overview of the structure of the paper with interleaved
        section callouts.
