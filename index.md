**Khadija & Maddy**

Introductory paragraph: Very briefly: What is the problem and
        why is it relevant to the audience attending *THIS CONFERENCE*?
        Moreover, why is the problem hard, and what is your solution?
        You must be brief here. This forces you to boil down your
        contribution to its bare essence and communicate it directly.

Background paragraph: Elaborate on why the problem is hard,
        critically examining prior work, trying to tease out one
        or two central shortcomings that your solution overcomes.
        
Transition paragraph: What keen insight did you apply
        to overcome the shortcomings of other approaches?
        Structure this paragraph like a syllogism:
        Whereas P and P => Q, infer Q.
        
Details paragraph: What technical challenges did you have
        to overcome and what kinds of validation did you perform?

Assessment paragraph: Assess your results and briefly state
        the broadly interesting conclusions that these results
        support. This may only take a couple of sentences. I
        usually then follow these sentences by an optional
        overview of the structure of the paper with interleaved
        section callouts.
