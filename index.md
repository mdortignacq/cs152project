# Risk Assessment Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System - An Ethical Investigation
### Khadija & Maddy

**Intro Outline**

Introductory paragraph: Risk assessment algorithms are a tool used by the courts, usually judges and prosecutors, that implement neural networks to predict the probablity of a defendent repeating criminal activity based on a selection of individual attributes (demographics, criminal history, etc.).

Background paragraph: Although these algorithms are an attempt to minimize personal and institutional bias in the judicial system, the algorithms are based on historical recidivism data that *has* been influenced by unequal institutional systems. When the inputs to an algorithm are biased the outputs are sure to display the same biases regardless of the intent of the designers or users.
        
Transition paragraph: This paper evaluates the data, neural network design, results, and real-world applications of algorithms developed for risk assesment in the criminal justice space.
        
Details paragraph: Using outputs from the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) algorithm, we determined patterns in the COMPAS scores assigned to defendent and tracked the accuracy of these scores with the recidivism status of the score's recipient.

Assessment paragraph: Our results find biases in a number of risk assesment algorithms used for the criminal justice system.

Ethical Implications:  Is it possible to create neural networks that resist the unjust biases of modern society? Do algorithms even have a place in determining justice, or are these decisions best left to human minds capable of empathy and compassion despite their biases?
