# Recipe Identifier
## Application Project

I’m interested in doing an application style project that takes a text file of recipes and/or ingredient lists, and uses a neural network to determine what the recipe makes. 

There are multiple difficulty and extension options that I have come up with. The most likely to succeed would be inputting entire recipes (ingredients, cooking techniques, oven temperature, etc.) within a food category such as baked goods. Options to extend the difficulty for the neural network include inputting only the ingredients and their quantities and/or expanding the types of dishes included. How fine-grained the identification parameters are could also be adjusted to make the problem harder or easier. Is “cake” a good enough answer or does the neural network need to specify “gooey butter cake”?

Applicable datasets already exist:




- [Ingredients only](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset?select=train.json) 
- [Whole recipes](https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions)

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mdortignacq/cs152project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
